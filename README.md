# General-Motors-Vehicle-Driveline-Modelling-and-Simulation
The automotive industry is in the midst of a revolution with increasing levels of investment in electric power units to replace internal combustion engines in current and future vehicles. While range anxiety is the leading factor preventing mass adoption by drivers worldwide, automotive manufacturers are placing a premium on drivability to ensure that the change from gas vehicles to electric vehicles is effortless. Drivability is the smoothness of a vehicleâ€™s operation, and in electric vehicles, the low-frequency vibrations from the electric driveline is the source of discomfort. This paper presents different control strategies to dampen low-frequency vibrations perceived by the human body while the vehicle is in operation. The work includes dynamic modeling of the system, linearization, system identification, classical control strategies, and advanced control strategies. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of each approach and assess controller performance in dampening low-frequency vibrations.
